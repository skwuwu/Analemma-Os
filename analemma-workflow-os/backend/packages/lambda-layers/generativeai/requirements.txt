google-ai-generativelanguage==0.6.15
# Use the official google-ai-generativelanguage package (pinned) which avoids
# pulling the heavy `google-api-python-client` into this layer. The large
# google-api-python-client is provided via an image-based Lambda at
# `layers/google_api_client/` (see `template.yaml`).

# Pin numpy to <2.0.0 to avoid build errors with GCC < 9.3 in Lambda environment
numpy<2.0.0
