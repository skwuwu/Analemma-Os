# LLM / LangGraph related heavy dependencies kept separate to avoid
# inflating the common layer. Attach this layer only to functions that
# actually need LLM/graph/model libraries (e.g., AsyncLLMHandler, SegmentRunner).

# Core LangChain packages moved to layers/llm_core/ for better caching

# LangGraph and related
langgraph>=1.0.0a4
langgraph-checkpoint-dynamodb>=0.1.0

# LLM Providers (these change more frequently)
openai>=1.12.0
anthropic>=0.18.1

# Utilities
dill==0.3.6

# Monitoring (can be moved to separate layer if needed)
